# Fortran modules for crystallography

Set of fortran modules with subroutines useful for crystallographic operations and data processing. They were used during the development of the tts methodology and most of them were implemented (and extended) later in d2Dplot software (2D XRD image processing). This is old code with no version control when programmed and uploaded to github in august 2022.
